					<td>Nintendo produced Mario, one of the most recognizable video game characters ever, who made his debut in Donkey Kong in 1981. Originally shown as "Jumpman," a carpenter, Mario was redesigned by Shigeru Miyamoto to become a plumber, a position that would become essential to his persona. Since then, Mario—who is easily recognizable by his red hat, blue overalls, and characteristic mustache—has emerged as the face of Nintendo and a mainstay of the gaming community.</td>
